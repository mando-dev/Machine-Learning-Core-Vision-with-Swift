# Machine-Learning-Core-Vision-with-Swift
You upload some pics on the app and it will give you a guesstimate of what it thinks it is. The app uses Apples Core ML Vision models. For example if you upload a pic of a bridge, the app will say: i am 85 percent confident this is a bridge.  Object recognition!
